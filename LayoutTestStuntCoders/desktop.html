              Doc, I, I don't know. Good Morning, Mom.
              It works, ha ha ha, it works. I finally invent something that works.
              Hey kid, what you do, jump ship? Uncle Joey didn't make parole again.

              Listen, can you meet me at Twin Pines Mall tonight at 1:15?
              I've made a major breakthrough, I'll need your assistance.
              Right. Save the clock tower, save the clock tower.
              Mayor Wilson is sponsoring an initiative to replace that clock.
              Thirty years ago, lightning struck that clock tower and the clock hasn't run since.
              We at the Hill Valley Society think it should be preserved.
